# <i class="fa fa-star"></i> JHipster Domain Language (JDL)

The JDL is a JHipster-specific domain language where you can describe all your applications, deployments, entities and
their relationships in a single file (or more than one) with a user-friendly syntax.

You can use our online [JDL-Studio](https://start.jhipster.tech/jdl-studio/) or one of the 
[JHipster IDE](https://www.jhipster.tech/jhipster-ide/) plugins/extensions, which are available for:
  - [Eclipse](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/jhipster-ide), 
  - [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jhipster-ide.jdl)

to create a JDL file and its UML visualization. You can create and export or share the URL of your JDL model as well.

This can be used as a replacement to using the [entity sub-generator]({{ site.url }}/creating-an-entity/) and is the
recommended approach.
The idea is that it is much easier to [manage relationships]({{ site.url }}/managing-relationships/) using a visual tool
than with the classical Yeoman questions and answers.

The JDL project is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-core/), it is an Open Source project like
JHipster (Apache 2.0 License). It can also be used as a node library to do JDL parsing.

_If you like the [JHipster Domain Language](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-core/),
the [JDL Studio](https://github.com/jhipster/jdl-studio/) or the
[JHipster IDE](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-ide/) don't forget to give them a star on
[GitHub](https://github.com/jhipster/) - thanks_!

If you don't know the JDL yet, it is recommended to go through the [Getting Started](/jdl/getting-started) page first.

However, if you're already familiar with the JDL and what you can do with it, you can also browse the detailed
documentation:
  1. [Applications](/jdl/applications)
  1. [Entities & fields](/jdl/entities-fields)
  1. [Enums](/jdl/enums)
  1. [Relationships](/jdl/relationships)
  1. [Options](/jdl/options)
  1. [Deployments](/jdl/deployments)
  1. [Troubleshooting](/jdl/troubleshooting)

You can also check the official [JDL sample repository](https://github.com/jhipster/jdl-samples) and propose examples 
if you want!
